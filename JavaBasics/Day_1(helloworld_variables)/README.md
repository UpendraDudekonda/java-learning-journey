📝 Notes

Every Java program starts with the main method.

System.out.println() prints text with a new line.

var automatically detects the data type at compile time, but it must be initialized immediately.

Variable names should:

start with a letter (not a number)

follow camelCase style for best practice

be meaningful (e.g., studentName, totalMarks)
